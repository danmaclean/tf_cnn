@article{pyrkov2018,
	Abstract = {Age-related physiological changes in humans are linearly associated with age. Naturally, linear combinations of physiological measures trained to estimate chronological age have recently emerged as a practical way to quantify aging in the form of biological age. In this work, we used one-week long physical activity records from a 2003--2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare three increasingly accurate biological age models: the unsupervised Principal Components Analysis (PCA) score, a multivariate linear regression, and a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We found that the supervised approaches produce better chronological age estimations at the expense of a loss of the association between the aging acceleration and all-cause mortality. Consequently, we turned to the NHANES death register directly and introduced a novel way to train parametric proportional hazards models suitable for out-of-the-box implementation with any modern machine learning software. As a demonstration, we produced a separate deep CNN for mortality risks prediction that outperformed any of the biological age or a simple linear proportional hazards model. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the emerging potential of combined wearable sensors and deep learning technologies for applications involving continuous health risk monitoring and real-time feedback to patients and care providers.},

abstract = {Summary We describe the development of a high-density Arabidopsis‘whole genome’ oligonucleotide probe array for expression analysis (the Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip® probe array) that contains approximately 22 750 probe sets. Precedence on the array was given to genes for which either expression evidence or a credible database match existed. The remaining space was filled with ‘hypothetical’ genes. The new ATH1 array represents approximately 23 750 genes of which 60\% were detected in RNA from cultured seedlings. Sensitivity of the array, determined using spiking controls, was approximately one transcript per cell. The array demonstrated high technical reproducibility and concordance with real-time PCR results. Indole-3 acetic acid (IAA)-induced changes in gene expression were used for biological validation of the array. A total of 222 genes were significantly upregulated and 103 significantly downregulated by exposure to IAA. Of the genes whose products could be functionally classified, the largest specific classes of upregulated genes were transcriptional regulators and protein kinases, many fewer of which were represented among the downregulated genes. Over one-third of the auxin-regulated genes have no known function, although many belong to gene families with members that have previously been shown to be auxin regulated. For the 6714 genes represented both on this and the earlier Arabidopsis Genome (AG) array, both signal intensities and gene expression ratios were very similar. Mapping of the oligonucleotides on the ATH1 array to the latest (version 4.0) annotation showed that over 95\% of the probe sets (based on version 2.0 annotation) still fully represented their original target genes.},

GRNs control different biological processes and have been instrumental to understand the organization and complexity of gene regulation. Although various experimental methods have been used to map GRNs in Arabidopsis thaliana, their limited throughput combined with the large number of TFs makes that for many genes our knowledge about regulating TFs is incomplete. We introduce TF2Network, a tool that exploits the vast amount of TF binding site information and enables the delineation of GRNs by detecting potential regulators for a set of co-expressed or functionally related genes. Validation using two experimental benchmarks reveals that TF2Network predicts the correct regulator in 75–92\\% of the test sets. Furthermore, our tool is robust to noise in the input gene sets, has a low false discovery rate, and shows a better performance to recover correct regulators compared to other plant tools. TF2Network is accessible through a web interface where GRNs are interactively visualized and annotated with various types of experimental functional information. TF2Network was used to perform systematic functional and regulatory gene annotations, identifying new TFs involved in circadian rhythm and stress response.}",

Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip® arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike‐in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG‐U95A human GeneChip® arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG‐U95A GeneChip® arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance–mean relationship with probe‐level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike‐in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model‐based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi‐array average (RMA) of background‐adjusted, normalized, and log‐transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike‐in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe‐specific affinities.}",

Comprehensive pair-wise correlations were calculated between gene expression and measures of agent susceptibility. Associations weaker than a threshold strength were removed, leaving networks of highly correlated genes and agents called relevance networks. Hypotheses for potential single-gene determinants of anticancer agent susceptibility were constructed. The effect of random chance in the large number of calculations performed was empirically determined by repeated random permutation testing; only associations stronger than those seen in multiply permuted data were used in clustering. We discuss the advantages of this methodology over alternative approaches, such as phylogenetic-type tree clustering and self-organizing maps.},

	issn = {2335-6928},
	abstract = {Given the immanent gene expression mapping covering whole genomes during development, health and disease, we seek computational methods to maximize functional inference from such large data sets. Is it possible, in principle, to completely infer a complex regulatory network architecture from input/output patterns of its variables? We investigated this possibility using binary models of genetic networks. Trajectories, or state transition tables of Boolean nets, resemble time series of gene expression. By systematically analyzing the mutual information between input states and output states, one is able to infer the sets of input elements controlling each element or gene in the network. This process is unequivocal and exact for complete state transition tables. We implemented this REVerse Engineering ALgorithm (REVEAL) in a C program, and found the problem to be tractable within the conditions tested so far. For n = 50 (elements) and k = 3 (inputs per element), the analysis of incomplete state transition tables (100 state transition pairs out of a possible 10(15)) reliably produced the original rule and wiring sets. While this study is limited to synchronous Boolean networks, the algorithm is generalizable to include multi-state models, essentially allowing direct application to realistic biological data sets. The ability to adequately solve the inverse problem may enable in-depth analysis of complex dynamic systems in biology and other fields.},
